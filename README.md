# Choreography
A tool to help make choreography vidoes

## General idea
The program will detect the video music beats, which will let the user easily add in choreography sequences. Then all this information will be compiled into a video, with the sound and image from the original video, but also the choreography steps showing on the screen at the correct times.

## Project pipeline

1. [x] Beat detection
2. [ ] Display beat as a text in a video
3. [ ] Display correct beat count, user can adjust this
4. [ ] Display text of predefined moves at the correct beat
5. [ ] The user can shuffle the moves to make their own choreography
6. [ ] The user can add their custom moves
